# OraclProduction
This Project is based off of the first 16 stepd of the OraclProduction program.
The file labeled Main.java was given on the repl.it submission page by Professor Vanselow.
This project uses a number of classes to demonstrate the power of inheritance.

The project creates three interfaces:
    Item
    MultimediaControl
    ScreenSpec
    
Two enum classes:

Four classes:
    AudioPlayer
